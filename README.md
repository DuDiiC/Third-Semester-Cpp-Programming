# Third Semester C++ Programming

Tasks from the laboratory: __Programming II__.

Tasks come from https://www.mat.umk.pl:8070/ZawodyWeb or they are additionally asked by the lecturer. 
Many tasks come from the https://uva.onlinejudge.org website.

I used the functional and objected-oriented programming paradigm and the C++14 standard.

### Issues doscussed during the course:

- the concept of class, object, method
- constructors and destructors
- getters and setters
- overloading operators and methods
- friend functions and class
- inheritance
- virtual classes and methods
- polimorphism
